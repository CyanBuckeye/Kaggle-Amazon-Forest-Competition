Kaggle Machine Learning Contest
===============================
Overview
-------------------------------
This is our team's solution to [Kaggle Competition of Understanding Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space). My friend Mao helped me train and finetune the deep learning model. All of code was written by myself. Finally, we ranked 78 among 938 teams and won a bronze medal with final score of 0.92966 (F2-score). 

About Contest
-------------------------------
In competition, we were asked to label over 60000 images. Each image has one or more labels among the following seventeen ones: cloudy, partly_cloudy, haze, water, habitation, agriculture, road, cultivation, bare_ground, primary, slash_burn, selective_logging, blooming, conventional_mine, artisinal_mine, blow_down and clear.

Essentially it is a multi-label classification task.
